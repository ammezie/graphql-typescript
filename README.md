# graphql-typescript

Getting started with GraphQL and TypeScript using TypeGraphQL - [https://pusher.com/tutorials/graphql-typescript](https://pusher.com/tutorials/graphql-typescript)

## Getting Started

Clone the project repository by running the command below if you use SSH

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:ammezie/graphql-typescript.git
```

If you use https, use this instead

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ammezie/graphql-typescript.git
```

After cloning, run:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Then compile the TypeScript files to JavaScript:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

And finally, start the application:

```bash
$ npm start
```

The server will be running on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
